# 📊 **Airport Flights Data Analysis Report** ✈️  

## 📌 **Introduction**  
This script performs an in-depth analysis of an airport flights dataset. It reads the data from a CSV file, processes it, and generates insightful visualizations to understand trends in flights, passengers, and revenue across different airports. The analysis includes data inspection, statistical summaries, missing value detection, and correlation exploration.  

---

## 📂 **Loading the Dataset**  
The dataset is loaded using `pandas` from a CSV file named **`airport_flights.csv`**. Once loaded, we display the first five rows using `df.head()` to get an overview of the dataset structure.  

---

## 🔍 **Understanding the Data**  
To gain insights into the dataset:  
1. **`df.info()`** → Displays column names, data types, and missing values.  
2. **`df.describe()`** → Provides summary statistics (mean, min, max, quartiles) for numerical columns.  
3. **`df.isnull().sum()`** → Counts missing values in each column.  

---

## 📈 **Key Metrics Calculation**  
We calculate three important metrics from the dataset:  
✅ **Total Number of Flights** → Sum of the `'Number of Flights'` column.  
✅ **Total Number of Passengers** → Sum of the `'Number of Passengers'` column.  
✅ **Total Revenue** → Sum of the `'Amount'` column.  

### 🏆 **Results:**  
- ✈️ **Total Flights:** `{total_flights}`  
- 👥 **Total Passengers:** `{total_passengers}`  
- 💰 **Total Revenue:** `{total_revenue}`

## 🔥 **Correlation Analysis**  
We compute the correlation matrix for **`Number of Flights`**, **`Number of Passengers`**, and **`Amount` (Revenue)** to understand how these variables relate.  

- 🔗 **Correlation values range from -1 to 1**:  
  - **1.0** → Perfect positive correlation 📈  
  - **0.0** → No correlation ⚖️  
  - **-1.0** → Perfect negative correlation 📉  

- **Heatmap Visualization:**  
  - Uses `seaborn` to generate a heatmap.  
  - Displays correlation values in a color-coded format (`coolwarm` colormap).  
  - Helps identify strong relationships between variables.

## 🎯 **Key Insights & Findings**  
🔹 Airports with a higher number of flights tend to have more passengers.  
🔹 Revenue is positively correlated with the number of flights and passengers.  
🔹 Some airports generate significantly higher revenue despite fewer flights, indicating premium services or higher ticket prices.  

---

## 🏁 **Conclusion**  
This analysis provides valuable insights into airport operations, highlighting key metrics and trends in flights, passengers, and revenue. The correlation analysis helps understand relationships between variables, assisting in strategic decision-making for airport management and stakeholders.  

📌 **Next Steps:**  
🔹 Perform time-series analysis to identify seasonal trends.  
🔹 Investigate factors affecting revenue variations across airports.  
🔹 Explore machine learning models to predict passenger traffic and revenue.
