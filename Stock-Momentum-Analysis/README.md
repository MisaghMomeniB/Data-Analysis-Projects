## Steps:
1. **Data Loading** 🗂️  
   Load stock data from a CSV file.  
   `df = pd.read_csv('Data.csv')`

2. **Date Formatting** 🗓️  
   Convert the 'Date' column to a proper datetime format and handle any errors.

3. **Data Cleaning** 🧹  
   Remove rows with missing or invalid 'Date' values, ensuring unique dates.

4. **Sorting & Missing Values** 🔄  
   Sort the data by date and forward-fill missing values.

5. **Descriptive Stats** 📈  
   Display basic statistics and an overview of the data.

6. **Technical Indicators** ⚙️  
   - **MACD**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence  
   - **Bollinger Bands**: Volatility measure  
   - **RSI**: Relative Strength Index  
   - **EMAs**: 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages

7. **Sharpe Ratio** 📊  
   Calculate the Sharpe Ratio for portfolio analysis (risk-adjusted return).

8. **ARIMA Forecasting** 📉  
   Use ARIMA to forecast stock prices for the next 10 days.

9. **Monte Carlo Simulation** 🎲  
   Simulate 1-year of stock prices with Monte Carlo methods.

10. **Backtesting** 🧑‍💻  
    Implement a Moving Average Crossover strategy and calculate the cumulative return.

11. **Visualization** 🖼️  
    Generate various plots:
    - **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Simulated price paths
    - **Cumulative Returns**: Strategy vs. Market return comparison
    - **Technical Indicators**: Plot RSI and MACD
    - **Interactive Visualizations**: Stock price and volume over time using Plotly.

12. **Save Results** 💾  
    Save the analyzed data as a new CSV file (`analyzed_stock_data.csv`).
